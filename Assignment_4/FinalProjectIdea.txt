For my final project I found some data from SAMHSA that involves drug use for each age group as well as the demographic and geographic information. I don't have a solid question im looking for in here but I think im just going to find some trends and see if they hold true for drug use and demographics.



This is the discription of the data by the organization 
"Results from the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed Tables is a collection of tables presenting national estimates from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). These tables present information for youths aged 12 to 17 and adults aged 18 or older (separately and combined) on drug, alcohol, and nicotine and tobacco product use, as well as substance use disorder (SUD), risk and availability of substance use, treatment, health topics, and alcohol consumption. For youths, additional topics include youth experiences and measures on mental health service utilization, major depressive episode (MDE), suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and treatment for depression (among youths with MDE). For adults, additional topics include measures on any mental illness (AMI), serious mental illness (SMI), AMI excluding SMI, mental health service utilization (i.e., treatment or counseling for mental health issues), suicidal thoughts and behaviors, MDE, treatment for depression (among adults with MDE), and serious psychological distress (SPD). Measures such as the co-occurrence of mental disorders with substance use or with SUDs also are presented for both adults and youths. Additionally, these tables present the perceived effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on substance use and mental health. Measures of these behaviors and characteristics are presented by a variety of demographic, geographic, and other variables. The estimates in the tables include prevalence rates of the behaviors, numbers of persons engaging in these behaviors, and other measures."
